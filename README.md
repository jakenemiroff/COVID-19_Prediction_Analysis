# COVID-19 Prediction Analysis

This project makes use of data provided by John Hopkins University detailing the number of daily cases, deaths, and recoveries of Covid-19 data.

In this project I try to make predictions and derive trends for the future number of cases based on a logistic regression model, and support vector machines.
